Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now low down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Once you play God, once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun
Like it's the day my kingdom come
